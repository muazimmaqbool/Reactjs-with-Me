## ⚡ New Way to Create a React Project (2024+)

> **Note:** As of 2024, `npx create-react-app` is no longer the recommended way to create new React applications.  
> Instead, use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a modern, fast, and simple React setup.

### Creating a New React App with Vite

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a new Vite + React project
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

# 2. Move into your project folder
cd my-react-app

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

- For TypeScript projects, replace `--template react` with `--template react-ts`.
- See the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for more options and details.

## 📦 Scripts

- `npm start` / `yarn start` – Start the development server
- `npm run build` / `yarn build` – Build for production
- `npm run lint` / `yarn lint` – Run ESLint
- `npm run format` / `yarn format` – Format code with Prettier
