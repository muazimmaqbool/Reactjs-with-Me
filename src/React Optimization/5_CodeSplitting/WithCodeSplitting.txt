I have already studied 'CodeSplitting' in detail checkout file:
                                    'CodeSplitting.jsx' which is inside 'Debounce' folder


->Code Splitting:
    Code splitting is a performance optimization technique used in React to break a large JavaScript bundle into smaller "chunks" that are loaded on demand, 
    only when needed by the user. This reduces the initial amount of code the browser needs to download and parse, 
    significantly improving initial page load times and overall performance.
