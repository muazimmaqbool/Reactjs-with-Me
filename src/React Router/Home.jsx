    ->What is React Router?
        React Router is a standard routing library for React. It enables you to create single-page applications (SPAs) 
        with multiple views without reloading the page. Instead of making full-page reloads like traditional websites,
        React Router allows users to navigate between components (pages) smoothly by changing the browser URL and rendering 
        components conditionally.

    ->Why Do We Need Routing?
        In a typical web app, you have multiple pages like:
        / → Home
        /about → About Us
        /contact → Contact Page
        Without a routing system, all of these would have to be handled manually with conditional rendering.
        React Router handles this for you, based on the URL.
