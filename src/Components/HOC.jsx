/*
-> What is a Higher Order Component?
    A Higher Order Component is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with extra powers.
    Think of it like a wrapper that injects extra props, logic, or styling into your component without modifying the original one.

    Formula: const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent);

-> Why use HOCs?
    Reuse logic between multiple components (before hooks existed, this was the main way).
    Add common features: authentication, logging, loading states, permissions, styling.
    Keep components pure and focused on UI, while HOC handles the extra logic.

->Basic Example: With Loading Spinner
    We want to add a loading spinner to any component that fetches data.
    Step 1 â€” A simple component: UserList component
    Step 2 - Create the HOC: withLoading
    step 3 - use it : const UserListWithLoading = withLoading(UserList);
