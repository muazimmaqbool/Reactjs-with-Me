/*learn about hooks from notebook and from w3schools */
/*
Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features.
Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed

What is a Hook?
Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods into function components.

Hook Rules
There are 3 rules for hooks:
    Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
    Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
    Hooks cannot be conditional
    
Note: Hooks will not work in React class components.
