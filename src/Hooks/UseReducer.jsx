->useReducer Hook:
  Think of useReducer as an alternative to useState when state logic becomes more complex, 
  like when multiple actions update the same state.
  or
  The useReducer hook in React provides an alternative to useState for managing component state, especially when dealing with more
  complex state logic or when state updates depend on the previous state. It is inspired by the Redux pattern.

->Why use useReducer?
  Use it when:
  State has multiple values
  State transitions follow specific actions
  You want cleaner state update logic

->Example cases: Form handling, complex UI components, state machines, etc.
